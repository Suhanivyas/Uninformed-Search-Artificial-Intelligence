# Uninformed-Search-Artificial-Intelligence
Given network & availability of pipelines for a city we have to find a best route for water based on the availability of the pipes in a given time using search algorithms. We are given the start time that water will start flowing and then we have to report the time which water reaches the other side of the city.
We will be using uninformed search algorithms i.e. we will be implementing Breadth First Search (BFS), Depth First Search (DFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS) for this .
